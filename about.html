<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>    
    This is [Allen.Z.Young](http://www.facebook.com/allzyoung), a college student who lives in Beijing (not THU or PKU). And, of course, a single boy of 18 who wish to meet a lovely and chaste girl.

    I'm studying for a Bachelor degree of Engineering now, and my major is computer software engineering.

    I like coding, especially in the aspects of data structure and algorithm, also pay attention to android developing and HTML. You know, programming can give me an aesthetic feeling of architecture and logic.

    As a young learner, I am very interested in physics, especially in electromagnetism and relativity, although I am not so good at calculus. I always focus on Applied Psychology and Economics, as well as Chinese History and Literature. Having maintained an enthusiasm on science and technology, I look forward them to change the whole world again. The philosophers I admire most are Descartes and Spinoza. Throughout the world, my favorite company is Google, as for Chinese companies, I prefer Tencent.

    You can read my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/allenzyoung).

    Have a nice day~
