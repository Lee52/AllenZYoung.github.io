This is [Allen.Z.Young](http://facebook.com/allzyoung), a college student who lives in Beijing(Not THU or PKU) at the moment. And, of course, a boy of 19 who wants to make a bright future. After a romantic blunder, I still wish to meet a lovely and chaste girl.

I'm studying for a Bachelor of Engineering now, and my major is computer software engineering.

I like coding, especially in the aspects of data structure and algorithm, also pay attention to android developing and HTML. You know, programming can give me an aesthetic feeling of architecture and logic.

I always focus on Applied Psychology and Economics, as well as Chinese History and Literature. I have maintained a good faith and enthusiasm on science and technology, looking forward them to change the whole world again. The philosophers I admire most are Descartes and Spinoza. Throughout the world, my favorite company is Google, as for Chinese companies, I appreciate Tencent a lot.

Have a nice day~ â™¥
